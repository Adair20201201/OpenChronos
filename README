== Status ==

Works, but in development :-)

== Requirements ==

msp430-gcc4 http://mspgcc4.sourceforge.net/
make
python http://python.org

== Supported Compilers ==

msp430-gcc4

Patches for more (more efficient) compilers are welcome :-)


== HOWTO ==

To configure your image, run:

   make config

which will generate a config.h file that contains the settings for your build.

To compile the image run:

   make


It is HIGHLY suggested to make a clean build befor you flash the image with:

   make clean main


== Difference to the TI Firmware ==

 * More Features that can be configured with make config
 * Day of week
 * Disable 12h support (saves space)
 * Sleep Phase Clock
 * The wireless flashing starts differently:
   Select RFBSL, Press DOWN to unlock, Press # long to start
